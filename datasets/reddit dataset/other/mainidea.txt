Audio (for speech stress/ emotion)
Extract features using librosa → MFCC, pitch, energy, jitter, RMS
Train a classification ML model
→ SVM / RandomForest / XGBoost

Facial Emotion
Extract features
Use OpenCV to detect landmarks / facial ratios
Or use a pretrained model like FAcial Emotion via FER to get features
Train an ML classifier
